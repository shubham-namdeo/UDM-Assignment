## HotWax’s brand voice: Above all, simple and human

There’s what we say, our message and there’s how we say it, our voice.

What do we mean by voice?

The HotWax voice is how we talk to people. It’s our personality, substance, tone, and style working together.

Though our voice is constant regardless of who we’re talking to or what we’re saying, we adapt our tone, from serious to empathetic to lighthearted, to fit the context.

### Three voice principles

Our voice hinges on crisp simplicity. Bigger ideas and fewer words. Less head, more heart. Our voice is:

* Warm and relaxed: We’re natural. Less formal, more grounded in real, everyday conversations. Occasionally, we’re fun. (We know when to celebrate.)

* Crisp and clear: We’re to the point. We write for scanning first, reading second. We make it simple above all.

* Ready to lend a hand: We show customers we’re on their side. We anticipate their real needs and offer great information at just the right time.

### Style tips

A few key elements of writing HotWax’s voice:

* Get to the point fast. Start with the key takeaway. Put the most important thing in the most noticeable spot. Make choices and next steps obvious. Give people just enough information to make decisions confidently. Don’t get in the way.

* Talk like a person. Choose optimistic, conversational language. Use short everyday words, contractions, and sentence-style capitalization. Shun jargon and acronyms.  
    
* Simpler is better. Everyone likes clarity and getting to the point. Break it up. Short sentences and fragments are easier to scan and read. Prune excess words.

## Brand identity

#### Fonts

Headings: Montserrat  
Body text: Open Sans

#### Company name

* Always use HotWax Commerce in full on first mention in a blog or a post.  
* Subsequent mentions can use HotWax if the context is clear.  
* Do not use Hotwax Commerce, lowercase (hotwax commerce), all caps (HOTWAX COMMERCE), or abbreviations (HW Commerce, HW).

### Do/Don’t examples

* Do (docs): Open the Fulfillment App and view all open orders. (imperative, second person)  
    
* Don’t (docs): One must navigate to the fulfillment app to view all open orders. (third person, formal)

* Do (marketing): “HotWax Commerce reduces shipping costs by routing orders to the ideal fulfillment location.”  
    
* Don’t (marketing): “HotWax Commerce effortlessly and seamlessly transforms your order fulfillment operations.” (banned buzzwords, see banned list below)

### Word choice

#### Words & phrasing, what to avoid and prefer

HotWax content should be straightforward and useful. Avoid the marketing‑fluff and prefer concrete claims, data, and examples.

Choose plain words that describe the action directly and avoid using:

“Ensure”  
“Seamlessly”, “effortlessly”, “swiftly”, “effortless”, “flawless”, “smooth”  
“Best‑in‑class”, “cutting‑edge”  
“Effiecient”  
“game-changer”  
“Leverage”  
“Streamline”  
Excessive adjectives like “vital”, “crucial”, “essential”

#### Core principles

* Use one term for one concept everywhere.

  Preferred: “order routing engine”, “routing logic”, use this in blogs, UI, and docs.

  Avoid: Switching between “allocation engine,” “routing tool”.

* Favor plain, recognizable language over jargon.

  Preferred: “start order sync”

  Avoid: “initiate the order synchronization process”

* Introduce technical terms with context.

  Define acronyms or uncommon industry terms the first time you use them.

  Example: HotWax supports BOPIS (Buy Online Pick Up In Store) workflows.

* Don’t invent new words or overly branded terms.  
    
* Write in US English.

  Preferred: fulfillment

  Avoid: fulfilment (UK spelling)

Consistent word choice reinforces clarity, prevents confusion, and keeps HotWax content aligned across blogs, documentation, product UI, and sales material.  
---

## Acronyms

Acronyms and abbreviations can make content harder to read and search. While some are well known and preferred over the full term, others are confusing or specific to small groups. Use them carefully.

* Don’t create acronyms from HotWax product or feature names  
    
  Always spell out HotWax Commerce product or feature names in full.  
  Avoid coining internal abbreviations that won’t be understood outside the team.

  Example:

  Write HotWax Omnichannel Order Management System, not “HW OOMS.”

* Only use acronyms your audience will know  
    
  Stick to acronyms that are standard in retail, commerce, or technology. If not, spell it out. Ask: Would a new reader outside my team understand this?

  Well-known examples:


  SKU (stock keeping unit)

  BOPIS (Buy Online Pick-Up In Store)

  API (application programming interface)

  ERP (enterprise resource planning)

* Always spell out first mention (unless universally known)  
    
  The first time a term appears, write the full term followed by the acronym in parentheses.  
    
  On later mentions within the same document, use the acronym alone.

  Example:

  Ship From Store (SFS) is a key omnichannel fulfillment strategy. Many retailers use SFS to increase sell-through rate.

  Exception:

  If the acronym is more widely recognized than its full form (e.g., API, URL, SKU), you can use it without spelling it out.

* Don’t introduce acronyms used only once  
    
  If a term appears only one time, write it out in full and skip adding the acronym.

* Avoid using acronyms in titles or headings  
    
  Use full terms in headings unless the acronym is important for SEO.  
  If the first appearance of the acronym is in a heading, introduce it again (spelled out) in the body text.  
    
* In posts, acronyms are used less frequently. Prefer writing out the full form directly, especially when the acronym is not very common or the post is short.

* Spelling and capitalization  
    
  Lowercase the spelled-out form unless it contains a proper noun.  
  Protocols and specifications (like HTML, SQL) are capitalized when spelled out.

* Articles (a vs. an)  
    
  Use a or an depending on pronunciation, not spelling.

* Making acronyms plural  
    
  Add a lowercase s with no apostrophe.  
  If the acronym already refers to something plural, don’t add another “s.”  
    
  Examples: three APIs, multiple SKUs

* Avoid the possessive form  
    
  Unless the acronym refers to a person or organization, avoid using apostrophes.  
    
  Examples:  
  The FAQ section (not the FAQ’s section)  
  The API documentation (not the API’s documentation)

---

## Capitalization

HotWax style uses sentence-style capitalization. This means you capitalize only the first word and any proper nouns, like brand, product, or solution names.

### General guidelines

Capitalization guidelines apply to the body text of all content formats, including documentation, blogs, website content, solution and thought leadership posts.

* Capitalize the first word of a sentence, heading, title, or standalone phrase.  
    
* Capitalize proper nouns (brands, products, solutions, people, and place names).  
    
  Company names (Shopify, NetSuite)  
  Products or solutions (ERP, POS, HotWax Commerce Order Management System, BOPIS App, Fulfillment App)  
  UI labels and menu options. If a UI label looks all caps, still use proper noun capitalization. (Submit, Order Details, Turn on the On/Off toggle)  
    
* Use lowercase for everything else.  
    
* Always capitalize the first word of a new sentence, even if it’s a term usually written in lowercase (rewrite the sentence if necessary).  
    
* Don’t use ALL CAPS for emphasis. Use italics sparingly if you need emphasis.  
    
  Example:  
  Wrong: Make sure to MARK THE ITEM AS RECEIVED in HotWax’s Receiving App.  
  Correct: Make sure to mark the item as received in HotWax’s Receiving App.  
    
* Don’t use all lowercase as a design choice. Although all caps may occasionally appear in graphics or logos, never use them in running text.  
    
* Don’t create internal capitalization (like AutoScale or e-Book) unless it’s part of an official brand name.  
    
* Only capitalize the spelled-out form of an acronym if it’s treated as a proper noun or a recognized term.  
    
  Example, capitalize: Buy Online Pick-Up In Store (BOPIS)  
    
  Use lowercase if it’s a generic description:   
  Example: “Order online and pick it up in store”

* When words are joined by a slash (/), capitalize the word after the slash if the word before the slash is capitalized.  
    
  Examples: Country/Region, Turn on the On/Off toggle. Do not use a space before or after the slash  
    
  Generic terms like “fulfillment,” “inventory,” “order routing,” unless part of a product name


### Sentence-style capitalization in titles and headings

Use sentence-style capitalization for titles, headings, blog posts, documentation articles, and press releases: capitalize the first word, lowercase the rest.

Exceptions: Proper nouns, including brand, product, and solution names are always capitalized. If a title or heading includes a colon, also capitalize the first word after the colon.

### Title-style capitalization (rare use)

Occasionally, title-style capitalization, capitalizing most words is required. For example:

* Product and solution names  
    
* Titles of blogs, white papers or docs  
    
* Job titles when mentioned formally (for example, Vice President or Director of Marketing)

Follow these rules when title-style capitalization is necessary:

* Always capitalize the first and last words.  
    
* Don’t capitalize a, an, or the unless it’s the first word.  
    
* Don’t capitalize prepositions of four or fewer letters unless they’re first or last.  
    
* Don’t capitalize and, but, or, nor, yet, or so unless they’re first or last.  
    
* Capitalize all other words: nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, pronouns.  
    
* Capitalize the word after a hyphen if it would normally be capitalized or if it’s the last word.

## Grammar and parts of speech

Simple grammar tends to be easy to read and understand, like a conversation. That basic grammar you learned before you were 12 is probably just right for most HotWax content.

### Active vs. passive voice

Prefer active voice to keep content clear and direct. Use passive voice only when the actor is unknown, unimportant, or when emphasizing the action itself.

Active: HotWax routes the order to the right store.  
Passive: The order is routed to the right store when criteria are met.

### Verbs & tenses

Readers expect HotWax content to be direct and actionable. That’s why we keep verbs active and present tense.

* Use present tense when describing HotWax features or workflows.

  Right: “HotWax routes orders to the right store.”


  Avoid: “HotWax will route orders…” sounds uncertain or future-only.


* In documentation, use the imperative mood (commands) for steps.

  Right: “Click `Save`.” “Select the store you want to fulfill orders from.”

  This keeps instructions short and clear.

* In thought leadership or first-person writing, past and future tense are fine to describe personal experience or vision.

  Example: “We built this capability to give merchants more control.”

### Person (First, second, third)

Different content types speak to readers differently. The person (I/we/you/they) should always match the format:

* #### User guides & product documentation

  Second person for direct guidance. “Filter orders by priority.”


* #### Blogs

  Both the second and third person, depending on the purpose of each section.  
    
  Use second person ("you", "your") when offering guidance, posing questions, or encouraging the reader to take action.  
    
  Example: “If you’re offering store pickup, make sure inventory availability is clearly visible on the PDP.”  
    
  Use third person ("retailers,", "they,", "brands") when discussing industry trends, insights, or broader challenges.  
    
  Example: “Many retailers struggle to offer accurate store-level availability, which limits BOPIS adoption.” “Retailers often lack visibility into store-level inventory.”

* #### Solution posts

  Use the second person to directly address the reader when explaining how to use a feature, solve a problem, or evaluate an option.  
    
  “You can configure routing rules in minutes.”  
    
  Use the third person when referring to retailers or when highlighting how HotWax Commerce products address specific challenges.

* #### Thought leadership

  Use first person (I, we) when sharing personal experiences, lessons learned, or leadership perspectives.


  Example: “We’ve worked closely with retailers to help them navigate multi-channel fulfillment complexity.”


  Use the second person to engage the audience, prompt reflection, or offer advice.


  Example: “You don’t need every store to offer same-day delivery, just the right ones.”


  Use third person when referring to the audience.

This way, content feels natural to its purpose: guides instruct, blogs inform, thought pieces share insight.

### Nouns and pronouns

Keep nouns simple and clear. Avoid internal jargon that outsiders won’t recognize.

Make pronouns unambiguous. If “it” or “they” could refer to more than one thing, repeat the noun.

Example:

Right: An OMS processes incoming orders and allocates them to optimal locations. The OMS also updates inventory in real time.

Avoid: “An OMS processes incoming orders and allocates them to optimal locations. It also updates inventory in real time.” (What’s it, the OMS or the location?)

### Words ending in-ing

“-ing” forms (participles or gerunds) can make writing longer or confusing if misused.

* Use them as nouns or modifiers rather than filler.  
* Avoid starting every sentence with “By doing X…”, it gets wordy.

  Example:

  Right: “Store-level inventory syncing improves accuracy.”

  Avoid: “By syncing store-level inventory, you are improving accuracy.”


### Parallel structure

Keep lists and series in the same grammatical form.

Correct: HotWax helps retailers track inventory, route orders, and manage fulfillment.  
Incorrect: HotWax helps retailers tracking inventory, routes orders, and managing fulfillment.

### Prepositions and modifiers

Keep modifiers close to the word they describe. Misplaced modifiers can confuse readers about what’s being explained.

Avoid cramming multiple descriptors into one sentence, break them up if needed.

Example:

Right: “Optimize inventory with store-first routing.”  
Avoid: “Optimize with store-first, multi-store, prioritized routing on inventory.” (too stacked)

### Contractions

Contractions (like don’t, can’t, it’s) are fine in blogs, solution pages, and thought leadership to keep a conversational tone.

Avoid contractions in formal documentation or API references to maintain clarity.

---

## Numbers

Use numbers consistently, and apply these rules across all HotWax content types:

### General guidelines

* Spell out zero through nine in running text  
  Example: five stores, three orders

* Use numerals for 10 and above, or for time, measurements, statistics  
  Example: 28 days, 3 hours, 5% return rate  
    
* Keep formatting consistent if mixed  
  Example: One order includes 8 items, another includes 5 items  
    
* When two numbers appear together, spell one out to avoid confusion  
  Example: fifteen 20-page reports  
    
* Never start a sentence with a numeral, spell it out or rephrase  
    
* Always use numerals with percentages, time, or units  
  Example: 3 hours, 5% growth, 2x faster routing

* Small numbers in tables or UI labels can use digits for clarity  
  Example: 7 stores, 4 SKUs

---

## 

## Lists

### General guidelines

* Use lists to make information clear and scannable.  
* Capitalize the first word of each bullet.  
* Add a period only if the bullet is a full sentence.  
* Avoid indentation, bold formatting, or a/b/c labeling.

### For blogs

* Bulleted lists, when items are related but order doesn’t matter.  
* Numbered lists, when steps must be followed in sequence or priority.

### For docs

Same as blog rules, but use numbered lists wherever steps or workflows are sequential.

### For solution and thought leadership posts (LinkedIn formatting)

LinkedIn does not support bullets natively:

* Use hyphens (-) for unordered lists.  
* Use 1, 2, 3 for ordered steps.

Keep the formatting simple and consistent.

---

## Punctuation

HotWax content follows consistent punctuation rules to keep blogs, solution posts, documentation, and thought leadership clear and professional.

### Colon (:)

Use a colon to introduce or emphasize:

* Lists or explanations  
  Example: There are three key features: inventory accuracy, real-time visibility, and customizable rules.

* A point at the end of a sentence  
  Example: Here’s the real challenge: most systems lack store-level data.

### Semicolon (;)

Use a semicolon to:

Link two closely related independent clauses

Example: The app supports multiple fulfillment types; it also helps reduce split shipments.

### Periods (.)

* End full sentences in regular paragraph text with a period.  
  Example: The inventory data syncs in near real time.

* Do not use periods at the end of bullet points in blogs, documentation, or solution posts unless the bullet point is a full paragraph or has multiple sentences.  
    
  Example:  
  Show store-level inventory in real time  
  Reduce split shipments through intelligent routing

### Hyphens (-) and em dashes (—)

* Use hyphens for compound terms or adjectives.  
  Examples: real-time data, store-level inventory, SKU-level details.

* Do not use em dashes (—) to join ideas or add emphasis. Use a comma or rewrite the sentence.

  Incorrect: HotWax Commerce supports store fulfillment — helping brands reduce delivery times.


  Correct: HotWax Commerce supports store fulfillment, helping brands reduce delivery times.


* Do not use hyphens to start lists. Use a colon and bullets instead.  
    
  Incorrect: Key benefits :- real-time inventory, faster fulfillment, fewer split shipments.  
    
  Correct: Key benefits:  
    
  * Real-time inventory  
  * Faster fulfillment  
  * Fewer split shipments

### Additional punctuation notes

Commas (,)  
Use in series and after introductory phrases. Never omit the final Oxford comma. 

Apostrophes (’)  
For contractions (don’t, you’re) and possession (HotWax’s feature list).

Quotation marks (")  
Use for quoting speech or terms. Periods and commas go inside.

Question marks/Exclamation points  
Use sparingly, only when they add value (e.g., titles, blog intros).

## 

## Headings

Headings organize content for the reader and make it easier to scan, search, and understand. In blogs, documentation, and carousels, headings also reflect how we structure our thinking, they aren’t decorative; they’re functional.

### General rules for all headings

Use sentence-style capitalization (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns).

Keep headings concise and descriptive, they should signal what the section covers, not just add emphasis.

Blogs

* H1 is automatically generated by the CMS. Never create a second H1 manually.  
    
* Use H2 for main sections, and H3/H4 for subsections to create a logical hierarchy.  
    
* Headings should describe the section’s content, not just restate the title.

Documentation

Headings must be structured, they populate the Table of Contents.

Use verbs to make headings action-oriented.

Example:

H1: Order Routing

H2: Configure order routing

H3: Step 1: Brokering runs

H4: Schedule multiple brokering runs

Social content and carousels

Social posts don’t need headings, they’re short-form and conversational.

Carousels require headings, each slide should clearly communicate its purpose.

Use sentence case for slide headings.

---

## Emphasis

Formatting guides the reader’s attention and should always serve a clear purpose. Overuse of bold, quotes, or other styling makes content harder to read. Follow these rules to keep emphasis clean and consistent.

### Use bold only for key-value pairs

* Bold text only when it acts as a label (key) that defines or introduces a specific value.

  Examples:


  **Store priority:** Based on layout and fulfillment capacity.


* Do not bold text before a colon when it simply introduces a list or explanation.  
    
  Example: HotWax improves three critical processes: inventory visibility, order routing, and fulfillment speed.  
    
* In blogs, all headings are already bold by default, do not add extra bold styling to headings or subheadings.

* App names or platform references can be bold in all content types (for example: Fulfillment App, Order Routing App).

### Use backticks in documentation

In documentation or internal guides, use backticks to format UI elements such as button names, labels, or page titles.

Examples:

Go to the `Open Orders` page to review pending shipments.

Click `Pick`, then `Pack` to process the order.

### Use quotation marks purposefully

* Direct quotes from people:

  “HotWax Commerce gave us the control we needed to route orders based on our business goals,” said the Director of Digital Operations at a premium lifestyle brand.

* Industry phrases or common language:

  Many brands still refer to this as the “final mile problem,” even though the real issue lies in upstream inventory visibility.


Key point: Formatting is not decoration. Bold and quotes should highlight meaning, never to add visual weight without purpose.  
---

## URLs and web addresses

How we format links depends on where the content appears.

### Blogs

Add hyperlinks over text, not as raw URLs.

Do: Read more in our order fulfillment guide.  
Don’t: Read more in our order fulfillment guide.  
[https://example.com/order-fulfillment-guide](https://example.com/order-fulfillment-guide)

CTA links open in the same tab.

Example: Book a demo: same tab.  
All other external links open in a new tab.

### Social posts

Include full URLs directly in the text.  
Use UTM-tagged links for tracking performance.  
LinkedIn posts cannot embed hyperlinks in text, so paste the URL plainly.  
Shorten URLs with an approved tool if they are long or messy.

### Documentation

Use relative links for internal pages. GitBook flags broken relative links if content moves, making them easier to find and fix.

Do: \[See configuration details\](../setup/configuration.md)  
Don’t: \[See configuration details\](https://docs.hotwaxcommerce.io/setup/configuration)

### External URLs (anywhere)

External URLs should open in a new tab when supported.

Prefer linking over naming raw URLs in text, unless posting on a platform (like LinkedIn) that doesn’t allow embedded links.

Avoid linking to pages that may move or change without notice, link to durable resources whenever possible.

## Formatting fundamentals: Avoiding common errors

These basics are deceptively simple and therefore the most frequently missed. Always double-check before publishing any content:

### Punctuation and spacing

* Periods and commas: Every sentence must end with a period, and commas must be placed correctly.  
    
* Bullets: If bullet points are complete sentences, end them with periods. If they’re fragments, no period is needed, but be consistent.  
    
* Extra spaces: Never leave two spaces between words or after punctuation. One space only.

### Paragraph formatting

* No leading spaces: When starting a new paragraph, make sure that the first word is aligned properly, no extra spaces or tabs.

  You don’t want it to look like this:


  Check your content before publishing.

    You don’t want it to look like this.


  Or this:


  Check your content before publishing.  You don’t want it to look like this.


  

  See that awkward gap before “You”? If you couldn’t notice that then that’s a real issue.

* No accidental spacing after edits: When accepting suggestions changes on a content piece, recheck for double spaces or missing punctuation.

These issues may seem small, but external readers will notice, and it impacts how professional HotWax content feels. Review every document, blog, website page, solution post, documentation for these issues before sign-off.

### Quick check before finalizing any content

* Read once for meaning.  
* Read again just for formatting, spacing, punctuation, alignment.  
* Use the “Find double spaces” trick (Command \+ F then search for two spaces).  
* Confirm headings, bullets, and paragraphs are styled consistently.
