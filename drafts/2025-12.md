# December 2025 Release Notes

The December 2025 release introduces updates across the Receiving App, Fulfillment App, Inventory Count App, Transfers App, Facilities App, and Users App to improve transfer management and inventory accuracy. These changes help retailers manage facility-specific settings more effectively and streamline counting workflows for better stock visibility.

## Receiving App

### Transfer order keyword search
Store teams often have trouble finding specific transfer orders when only an order ID or name is available. The app now supports searching for transfer orders using keywords like the order ID or order name. This reduces the time spent looking for specific shipments and speeds up the receiving process.

### Scan and complete workflows
Users need a clear signal when a transfer order is fully received to avoid leaving sessions open by mistake. The primary action button now changes to `Receive and Complete` when all items in a transfer order are scanned. This ensures orders are closed accurately and reflected in inventory systems immediately.

### Tracking code accessibility
Tracking information for transfer orders is often needed for cross-referencing but hard to copy from the UI. The `Transfer Order Detail` page now includes a button to copy tracking codes directly to the clipboard. This makes it easier for teams to share shipment details or track packages in external carrier portals.

## Fulfillment App

### Shipment and carrier updates
Store associates sometimes need to correct shipment or carrier details while shipping transfer orders without navigating away from the page. The `Ship Transfer Order` page now allows users to update shipment and carrier information directly. This ensures shipping data remains accurate without interrupting the fulfillment workflow.

## Inventory Count App

### Real-time variance logging
Inventory variance can shift between the start of a count and its submission, leading to inaccurate adjustments. The app now logs variance based on the quantity on hand at the moment of submission rather than the start of the session. This provides a more accurate reflection of stock levels and reduces inventory discrepancies.

### Undirected item support
During a count, associates often find items that were not part of the original directed list and need a way to record them. Users can now submit undirected items as part of an active count session. This captures all physical stock in a single workflow and improves overall store inventory visibility.

### Automated out-of-stock marking
Manually updating individual items as out of stock during a large inventory count is time-consuming. The app now includes a checkbox to mark all uncounted items as out of stock during the progress review. This allows teams to quickly reconcile missing inventory and focus on active stock.

## Transfers App

### Product addition queue
Adding multiple products to a transfer order in quick succession can sometimes cause errors or slow down the interface. A new sequential product addition queue manages entries one by one to ensure every item is recorded correctly. This prevents data loss and maintains app performance during high-volume transfer creation.

### Facility search bar
Selecting origin facilities from a long list makes creating transfer orders tedious for retailers with many locations. A search bar is now available within the facility selection modal to quickly filter locations. This speeds up the transfer creation process and reduces manual scrolling.

## Facilities App

### Facility timezone management
Global retailers often struggle to coordinate tasks when apps default to a single system timezone instead of the local facility time. HotWax Commerce now includes a switcher to manage and assign specific timezones to each location. This ensures that scheduling and deadlines are displayed correctly for local store teams.

### Enhanced location details
New staff or delivery drivers often need more than just an address to find a specific facility or loading dock. Facilities now support map URLs and detailed direction descriptions within their profiles. This improves logistics coordination and helps onsite teams locate facilities more easily.
