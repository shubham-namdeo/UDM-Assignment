# January 2026 Release Notes

The January 2026 release introduces updates across the Fulfillment App, Inventory Count App, BOPIS App, and Receiving App to improve inventory accuracy and order communication. These changes help retailers manage store-level operations with greater precision and provide customers with timely updates on their orders.

## Fulfillment App

### Carrier selection for ship-to-store orders
Users could accidentally select incorrect carriers for ship-to-store orders, which caused inconsistencies between the intended and actual shipping methods. The Fulfillment App now restricts carrier selection to preserve the original shipment method for these specific orders. This prevents data errors and maintains shipping consistency throughout the fulfillment process. PU

## Inventory Count App

### Discontinued product filters
When performing inventory counts, store teams often find it difficult to differentiate between active and discontinued products in their lists. A new filter allows users to identify or exclude products in the discontinued category while scanning. This helps teams focus on relevant stock and increases counting efficiency. PU

### Scan removal confirmation
Users could accidentally delete scan entries with a single click, leading to lost work and the need for re-scanning items. The app now displays a confirmation modal before any scan event is removed. This prevents accidental data loss and maintains the integrity of the inventory count. PU

### Live search for matching products
Finding specific products in the match product modal was slow because users had to submit full queries to see results. Live search is now available within the match product modal to provide instant results as users type. Store associates can find and link products much faster during the counting process. PU

### Primary and secondary identifier support
Reviewing inventory variances was difficult when staff only had access to a single type of product identifier. The variance review list now supports both primary and secondary product identifiers, such as SKU and UPC. This allows staff to verify items using the IDs they use most often in their daily tasks. PU

### Local database management
Large amounts of cached data can occasionally cause performance issues or sync conflicts within the app. Users can now use a new action to clear the local database directly from the settings. This provides a quick way to resolve local data issues and improve app performance without needing to reinstall. PU

### Quantity on hand synchronization
Syncing inventory counts could fail or result in incorrect levels if quantity on hand (QOH) data was missing or handled inconsistently. The app now handles missing QOH during sync and correctly updates systemic levels when marking uncounted items as out of stock. These updates help maintain accurate inventory records across all integrated systems. PU

## BOPIS App

### Proof of delivery for order pickup
Retailers lacked a formal way to document that a customer actually received their items during a store pickup. The BOPIS App now includes a proof of delivery modal and specific settings to require this step before an order is completed. This creates a clear audit trail for every handover and helps resolve potential customer disputes. PU

### Automated handover notifications
Customers often need immediate confirmation for their records after they pick up an order from a store. Support for order handover emails and enhanced status notifications has been added to the pickup workflow. This improves the customer experience by providing instant communication the moment they leave the store with their items. PU

### Ship-to-store workflow improvements
Managing the transition between standard pickup orders and ship-to-store orders was inconsistent, which occasionally confused store staff. The app now features improved logic for ship-to-store features and a static search bar for more reliable navigation. Store teams can now manage different fulfillment types more effectively from a single interface. PU

### Picker assignment controls
Orders could be edited or pickers changed even after an order was already rejected or handed over, leading to inaccurate fulfillment history. The app now disables the edit picker button once an order reaches a final status. This prevents unauthorized changes and maintains the accuracy of the store's performance data. PU

## Receiving App

### Push notifications for transfer orders
Store associates were not always aware when new transfer orders arrived at their location, causing delays in getting stock to the sales floor. The Receiving App now sends push notifications when new transfer orders are created or remain pending. Staff can react quickly to incoming stock and reduce the time inventory spends sitting in the backroom. PU

### Visibility for mis-shipped items
When receiving a shipment, items that were not on the original manifest were difficult to track once the receipt was finalized. The app now displays mis-shipped items within both the "All" and "Completed" tabs of a transfer. This provides full visibility into shipment discrepancies and helps with more accurate inventory reconciliation. PU

### Product visibility in receiving lists
Occasional issues with underlying package versions caused some products to be hidden from view during the receiving process. An update to the core package ensures that all products in a shipment remain visible as expected. This removes friction for the receiving team and helps them account for every item in a delivery. PU
