# January 2026 Release Notes

The January 2026 release introduces updates across the Inventory Count, BOPIS, Receiving, and Fulfillment Apps to improve inventory accuracy and notification workflows. These changes provide store teams with better visibility into stock levels and handover processes, helping retailers maintain high fulfillment standards.

## Inventory Count App:

### Filter for discontinued products
Store associates often waste time counting items that are no longer for sale, which clutters inventory reports and slows down the audit process. The Inventory Count App now includes a filter to exclude products in the `DISCONTINUED` category from active counts. This helps teams focus on active stock and improves the relevance of inventory data. PU

### Confirmation modal for scan removal
Accidental deletions of scanned items can lead to data loss and require associates to restart their counting tasks. We added a confirmation modal that appears whenever a user attempts to remove a scan event. This safeguard prevents data entry errors and helps maintain the integrity of inventory cycles. PU

### Live search in match product modal
Identifying the correct product during a count is difficult when associates must scroll through long lists of similar items. The match product modal now supports live search, which updates results in real time as the user types. Associates can find and link products more quickly, reducing the time spent on manual lookups. PU

### Agent execution model
Complex inventory tasks often require a series of manual steps that are difficult to manage and prone to human error. We implemented an agent execution model that automates the processing of specific inventory instructions within the app. This automation helps maintain consistency across different inventory workflows and reduces the manual workload for store teams. PU

### Primary and secondary identification support
Associates may need to identify products using different types of IDs, such as internal SKUs or external barcodes, depending on the inventory task. The app now supports both primary and secondary IDs within variance review lists. This provides greater flexibility during the review process and makes it easier to verify product details. PU

### Systemic quantity on hand accuracy
When associates mark uncounted items as out of stock, the system needs to accurately reflect the change in Quantity on Hand (QOH). We fixed an issue to help the app correctly handle systemic QOH when syncing inventory updates. This keeps stock records accurate across all channels and prevents overselling. PU

## BOPIS App:

### Proof of delivery support
Retailers need a way to verify that the correct customer picked up an order to prevent fraud and resolve disputes. We added a proof of delivery settings card and a user interface modal to capture handover details, along with specific permissions to manage these requests. Store associates can now confidently verify order pickups, reducing the risk of unauthorized handovers. PU

### Automated order handover emails
Customers expect immediate confirmation when they pick up an order, but associates may forget to send manual status updates during busy shifts. The BOPIS App now supports automated order handover emails and enhanced status notifications. This improves the customer experience by providing instant digital receipts for in-store pickups. PU

### Enhanced ship-to-store implementation
Orders intended for store pickup sometimes require items to be shipped from a distribution center to the store first if local stock is unavailable. We improved the Buy Online Pick Up In Store (BOPIS) to Ship-to-Store workflow to better handle these multi-step fulfillment paths. Retailers can offer a wider product selection for store pickup without needing every item in stock at every location. PU

### Picker assignment restrictions
Allowing associates to edit pickers after an order is rejected or completed can lead to confusing audit trails and fulfillment errors. The app now disables the `Edit Picker` button once an order is handed over or rejected. This helps maintain the accuracy of fulfillment records and prevents unnecessary changes to completed tasks. PU

## Receiving App:

### Push notifications for transfer orders
Store teams often lack real-time visibility when new transfer orders arrive, leading to delays in receiving stock and restocking shelves. The Receiving App now supports push notifications through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to alert users about new and pending transfer orders. This helps teams prioritize incoming stock faster and reduces the time items spend waiting to be processed. PU

### Visibility for mis-shipped items
When items arrive that were not originally part of a transfer, teams need a way to review those discrepancies after the receipt is finished. The app now displays mis-shipped items in the `All` and `Completed` tabs for easier reconciliation. Retailers gain better visibility into shipping errors and can update their inventory records more accurately. PU

## Fulfillment App:

### Carrier selection for ship-to-store orders
Incorrect carrier assignments on ship-to-store orders can lead to shipping delays and higher transportation costs. The Fulfillment App now restricts carrier selection to preserve the original shipment method intended for ship-to-store orders. This helps maintain shipping accuracy and prevents unauthorized changes to fulfillment plans. PU
