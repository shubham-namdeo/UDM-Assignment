# January 2026 Release Notes

The January 2026 release introduces updates across Receiving, BOPIS, Fulfillment and Inventory Count to improve transfer handling, support Ship-to-Store for BOPIS orders and enhance inventory accuracy. These changes help reduce manual intervention and keep store workflows running smoothly.

## Receiving App:

### Push notifications for Transfer Orders
Store teams need timely visibility into new and pending transfer orders to take receiving action without delay. The Receiving App now sends push notifications when transfer orders are created or remain pending. This helps with faster response to incoming transfers and reduced reliance on manual order checks. PU

### Manually Added Items Shown in Completed Transfers
Store teams may receive additional or incorrect items while completing transfer receiving and need visibility into those items after they are recorded. The Receiving App now displays manually added items as received within the corresponding Transfer Order. This helps with accurate transfer reconciliation and reduces follow-up between sending and receiving locations. PU

## BOPIS App:

### Ship-to-store
Limited inventory at the pickup store often results in BOPIS order cancellations and lost sales. These orders can now be converted to Ship-to-Store from the BOPIS App, allowing fulfillment to continue while preserving the original pickup experience. PU

### Configure Facility-level Proof of Delivery for Pickups
Operations teams need to enforce Proof of Delivery selectively based on facility-specific pickup policies and risk considerations. Proof of Delivery can now be configured per facility for BOPIS pickups. This helps apply pickup verification only where required and keeps handover workflows unchanged at other locations. PU

## Fulfillment App:

### Static Search Bars
Store associates often lose access to search functionality when scrolling through long order lists, requiring them to scroll back to the top. The search bars in the Fulfillment App now remain static at the top of the screen. This helps save time by keeping search tools always accessible, even when scrolling through long lists of orders. PU

### Order Handover Notifications
Customers need to know when their orders are ready for pickup to plan their store visit. The Fulfillment App now sends automated email notifications when orders are ready for pickup or have been successfully handed over. This helps keep customers informed with real-time updates throughout the pickup process. PU

## Inventory Count App:

### Enhanced Product Identification in Inventory Counts
Store teams struggle to locate products during counts when only one identifier is available, slowing down the counting process. The Inventory Count App now supports primary and secondary identifiers (such as internal names or SKUs) across the Assigned, Pending Review, and Closed lists. This helps find and sort products more easily during counts using the identifiers that make the most sense for your warehouse or store. PU

### Partial Sync for Inventory Records
A single data error during inventory sync previously blocked the entire count from being saved, forcing teams to troubleshoot before any progress could be recorded. The Inventory Count App now handles missing "Quantity on Hand" (QOH) data more intelligently by blocking only the problematic record and allowing the rest of the count to sync successfully. This helps prevent your entire inventory sync from getting stuck due to a single data error, ensuring most of your work is saved immediately. PU

### Local Database Management
Store teams previously needed technical assistance to clear cached data when troubleshooting local data issues. Users can now clear cached data directly from the Settings menu in the Inventory Count App. This helps quickly troubleshoot local data issues or refresh your app's cache without needing technical assistance.
