# January 2026 Release Notes

The January 2026 release introduces updates across the Receiving App, BOPIS App, OMS, Fulfillment App, and Inventory Count App to improve transfer handling, support ship-to-store workflows, and enhance inventory accuracy. These changes help retailers manage complex omnichannel operations and maintain reliable stock levels across all locations.

## Receiving App:

### Push notifications for transfer orders
Store teams need immediate visibility into new transfer orders to avoid receiving delays and handle incoming stock. The Receiving App now sends push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) when new transfer orders are created. This helps teams respond faster to incoming shipments and reduces the need for manual order checks.

### Mis-shipped items visibility
When items are received that were not on the original transfer, staff often lose visibility of these discrepancies once the transaction is finished. The app now displays mis-shipped items within the “All” and “Completed” tabs. This helps with accurate reconciliation and inventory tracking for unexpected receipts.

### Product visibility improvements
Outdated package versions can sometimes prevent product details from loading correctly during the receiving process. The app was updated to a newer version of the OMS package to resolve visibility issues. This helps store associates identify products quickly and accurately as they arrive.

## BOPIS App:

### Ship-to-store support
If a pickup store lacks inventory, retailers risk losing sales or forcing customers to travel elsewhere. The BOPIS App now supports ship-to-store workflows, allowing items to be sent from a warehouse or another store to the customer’s preferred pickup location. This helps maintain high fulfillment rates while preserving the customer pickup experience.

### Proof of delivery
Store associates often lack a formal way to confirm that an order was handed over to the correct customer, especially for high-value items. A new proof of delivery modal and settings card allow stores to require confirmation before completing a handover. This helps reduce disputes and improves pickup security.

### Handover notifications
Customers need confirmation when their order is picked up to know their records are accurate and to prevent fraud. The app now supports order handover emails and enhanced status notifications. This helps build customer trust and provides clear communication at the end of the pickup process.

## OMS:

### Payment capture tags
In multi-item orders, retailers may want to trigger specific financial processes as soon as the first part of the order is ready. HotWax Commerce now includes a service that creates a capture payment tag when the first item in an order is completed. This helps with faster payment processing and more accurate financial reporting.

### Transfer order API filtering
Operations teams often need to filter large volumes of transfer orders by specific stages to identify bottlenecks. The Transfer Orders API now supports filtering by multiple status flow IDs. This helps teams generate granular reports and manage transfer workflows more effectively.

### Picker management
High-volume stores need to manage their picking staff effectively to make sure orders are fulfilled on time. New picker data setup and indexing services help maintain a list of active pickers for assignment. This helps prevent fulfillment errors and keeps picking queues organized.

### Real-time inventory availability
Retailers need accurate, real-time data on how much stock is available to sell online to avoid overselling. The OMS now includes a service to calculate product online ATP (Available to Promise) instantly. This helps maintain accurate stock levels across digital storefronts.

## Fulfillment App:

### Carrier restrictions for ship-to-store
When orders are shipped to a store rather than a home address, using the wrong carrier or method can cause receiving issues at the destination. The Fulfillment App now restricts carrier selection and preserves the specific shipment method for ship-to-store orders. This helps maintain shipping consistency and ensures the receiving store is prepared for the delivery.

## Inventory Count App:

### Discontinued product filtering
Counting discontinued products that are no longer being sold can waste time during store-wide inventory audits. The Inventory Count App now allows users to filter out products in the discontinued category. This helps store teams focus on active stock and speeds up the counting process.

### Scan removal confirmation
Accidentally deleting a scan during a large inventory count can lead to data loss and require staff to recount entire sections. The app now includes a confirmation modal that appears before a scan event is removed. This helps prevent data entry errors and maintains count integrity.

### Local database management
Stale data stored on devices can sometimes cause sync errors or performance issues during heavy counting periods. Users can now manually clear the local database directly within the app. This helps keep the app running quickly and ensures that only current data is processed.

### Variance review identifiers
Associates reviewing inventory variances often need to cross-reference items using different identification codes. The app now supports both primary and secondary IDs in variance review lists. This helps staff identify products more easily and reduces the time spent on inventory reconciliation.
