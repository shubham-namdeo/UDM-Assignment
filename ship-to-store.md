## Ship to Store for BOPIS Orders

Recover unfulfillable BOPIS orders by continuing fulfillment through a warehouse while keeping the original pickup experience intact.

**Subheading:** For retail operations and store teams who want to reduce BOPIS cancellations caused by limited store inventory.


## Summary

Ship to Store allows BOPIS orders to continue through fulfillment even when the pickup store does not have sufficient inventory.  
Instead of cancelling the order, store teams can convert it to a Ship-to-Store flow directly from the BOPIS App while keeping the original pickup location unchanged.  
This helps retailers avoid lost sales, manage inventory exceptions smoothly, and deliver a consistent pickup experience to customers.


## Problem

Limited inventory at the pickup store frequently results in BOPIS order cancellations.  
These cancellations lead to lost revenue, customer frustration, and additional operational effort to manage exceptions.  
Until now, store teams had limited options and often had to cancel or recreate orders when inventory was unavailable locally.


## Solution

Ship to Store enables store associates to convert unfulfillable BOPIS orders into warehouse-fulfilled shipments that are delivered to the original pickup store.  
The order remains within the BOPIS flow and continues through fulfillment without manual intervention or order recreation.  
Once the shipment arrives, the order follows the standard BOPIS receiving and handover process, keeping the customer experience unchanged.


## Getting Started

Ship to Store is supported directly within the BOPIS App.  
When processing a BOPIS order that cannot be fulfilled due to inventory or operational constraints, associates can select **Request Transfer** to convert it to Ship-to-Store.  
The order then becomes visible in the Ship-to-Store section for tracking through arrival and pickup.


## Call to Action

Use Ship to Store from the BOPIS App to convert unfulfillable BOPIS orders instead of cancelling them.  
Start with the next inventory-constrained order to reduce cancellations while preserving the in-store pickup experience.
