All Release Data (organized by app):
${consolidatedData}

Task:
Generate consolidated monthly release notes following this EXACT structure and methodology:

# ${formattedMonth} Release Notes

[Write ONE introductory paragraph that:
- Summarizes the month's key themes and focus areas
- Lists the apps/products that received updates
- Highlights the overall business impact
- Keeps it concise (2-3 sentences max)
Example: "The ${formattedMonth} release introduces updates across [list apps] to [key themes]. These changes help [overall impact]."]

[For each app/product that has updates, create a section:]

## [App/Product Name]:

[For each feature/update in this app, use this problem-solution structure:]

### [Feature Name]
[Problem statement - 1-2 sentences describing the user challenge or business need that existed before this feature]
[Solution - 1-2 sentences explaining what the feature does and how it works]
[Impact - 1 sentence describing the practical benefit and how it helps] PU

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
1. Title format: "${formattedMonth} Release Notes" (not "HotWax Commerce Product Update")
2. Organize by app/product (Receiving App, BOPIS App, OMS, etc.) - NOT by feature type
3. Each feature follows: Problem → Solution → Impact
4. End each feature with "PU" (Product Update reference)
5. NO emoji sections (🚀 or ⚡)
6. NO "User Benefit:" labels - integrate benefits into the narrative
7. Use sentence-style capitalization
8. Keep each feature description to 3-4 sentences total
9. Problem statement should describe what users struggled with BEFORE
10. Solution should explain what the feature does NOW
11. Impact should explain how this HELPS users

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Be concise and narrative-driven
- Avoid marketing fluff ("seamlessly", "effortlessly", etc.)
- Focus on practical business/operational impact
- Use clear, direct language
- Each section should flow naturally as a story: challenge → solution → benefit
- Write in present tense for solutions ("The app now sends..." not "The app will send...")
- Keep tone professional but warm (following HotWax voice)

ORGANIZATION:
- Group all changes by their app/product
- Within each app section, list features in order of importance
- If a repository doesn't map to a specific app, categorize it under "OMS"

DO NOT:
- Invent features not mentioned in the release data
- List contributors
- Include raw GitHub sections
- Use "User Benefit:" or similar labels
- Categorize by "New Features" vs "Improvements"
- Add extra formatting or sections beyond what's specified

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
# January 2026 Release Notes

The January 2026 release introduces updates across Receiving, BOPIS, Fulfillment and Inventory Count to improve transfer handling, support Ship-to-Store for BOPIS orders and enhance inventory accuracy. These changes help reduce manual intervention and keep store workflows running smoothly.

## Receiving App:

### Push notifications for Transfer Orders
1. Store teams need timely visibility into new and pending transfer orders to take receiving action without delay. The Receiving App now sends push notifications when transfer orders are created or remain pending. This helps with faster response to incoming transfers and reduced reliance on manual order checks.
2. Manually Added Items Shown in Completed Transfers
   Store teams may receive additional or incorrect items while completing transfer receiving and need visibility into those items after they are recorded. The Receiving App now displays manually added items as received within the corresponding Transfer Order. This helps with accurate transfer reconciliation and reduces follow-up between sending and receiving locations. 

## BOPIS App:

### Ship-to-store
1. Limited inventory at the pickup store often results in BOPIS order cancellations and lost sales. These orders can now be converted to Ship-to-Store from the BOPIS App, allowing fulfillment to continue while preserving the original pickup experience.

### OMS
1. Shipping Price Rules Configurable from OMS
   Shipping charges may be adjusted as part of promotional strategies and cost management. Checkout shipping prices are now configurable directly from the OMS, allowing teams to manage pricing centrally without storefront changes.
